# Implementation Plan: API WebApp with Color Management

**Branch**: `001-api-webapp-with` | **Date**: 2025-09-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/workspaces/.devcontainer/specs/001-api-webapp-with/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✅ COMPLETED: Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → ✅ COMPLETED: Project Type detected as web API, technical details provided
   → ⚠️  NOTED: One NEEDS CLARIFICATION remains about SetColor conflict handling
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
   → ✅ COMPLETED: Constitution requirements evaluated
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ COMPLETED: No violations detected, constitutional compliance verified
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✅ COMPLETED: Technology research and decisions documented
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
   → ✅ COMPLETED: All design artifacts generated
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → ✅ COMPLETED: Post-design constitutional compliance verified
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   → ✅ COMPLETED: Task generation approach defined
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 9. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Build a Color Management API WebApp with four core endpoints (GetAllColors, GetColor, GetRandomColor, SetColor) and integrated Swagger UI documentation. Technical approach: .NET 9.0 ASP.NET Core Web API with in-memory storage using concurrent collections for thread safety, OpenAPI/Swagger integration for documentation, and comprehensive testing following TDD principles per constitution requirements.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: .NET 9.0 with C#  
**Primary Dependencies**: ASP.NET Core Web API, Swashbuckle.AspNetCore for Swagger UI, System.Collections.Concurrent for thread-safe in-memory storage  
**Storage**: In-memory using ConcurrentDictionary for thread-safe operations  
**Testing**: xUnit with Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing for integration tests, Moq for mocking  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux/Windows/macOS) web server  
**Project Type**: Single web API project  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms response time (95th percentile) per constitution requirements  
**Constraints**: Thread-safe concurrent access, stateless design for scalability, comprehensive error handling  
**Scale/Scope**: Single API service with 4 endpoints, designed for high concurrency and low latency

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Code Quality Standards
- ✅ **Static Analysis**: Will configure EditorConfig, StyleCop analyzers, and SonarAnalyzer for C# code quality
- ✅ **Code Review**: Plan includes peer review requirement in development workflow
- ✅ **Documentation**: API endpoints will be fully documented via Swagger/OpenAPI specifications
- ✅ **Technical Debt**: Simple in-memory design minimizes initial technical debt; tracking via GitHub issues

### II. Test-First Development (TDD)
- ✅ **TDD Mandatory**: Plan explicitly includes contract tests before implementation (Phase 1)
- ✅ **90% Coverage**: xUnit test framework with coverage tools configured for minimum 90% target
- ✅ **Contract Tests**: OpenAPI contract tests for all 4 API endpoints (GetAllColors, GetColor, GetRandomColor, SetColor)
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Full HTTP request/response cycle testing with Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing

### III. User Experience Consistency
- ✅ **Design System**: Swagger UI provides consistent API documentation interface
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Swagger UI inherently meets accessibility standards for API documentation
- ✅ **Error Patterns**: Standardized HTTP status codes and error response formats across all endpoints
- ✅ **Performance**: Sub-200ms response time requirements clearly defined

### IV. Performance Requirements
- ✅ **API Response Times**: <200ms (95th percentile) explicitly targeted through efficient in-memory operations
- ✅ **Resource Monitoring**: Plan includes performance testing and monitoring setup
- ✅ **Scalability**: Thread-safe concurrent collections enable horizontal scaling potential
- ✅ **Performance Testing**: Load testing strategy defined for validating response time requirements

### V. Observability and Monitoring
- ✅ **Structured Logging**: ASP.NET Core ILogger with correlation IDs for request tracing
- ✅ **Metrics Collection**: Built-in ASP.NET Core metrics for request timing and throughput
- ✅ **Health Checks**: ASP.NET Core health checks for service availability monitoring
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Application Insights or equivalent APM tool integration planned

**GATE STATUS**: ✅ PASS - All constitutional requirements addressed in design

**Structure Decision**: Single web API project structure selected as this is a focused microservice with clear API boundaries. No frontend components required as Swagger UI provides the user interface for API interaction.
api/
└── [same as backend above]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure: feature modules, UI flows, platform tests]
```

**Structure Decision**: [Document the selected structure and reference the real
directories captured above]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
