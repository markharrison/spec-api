# Technology Research: Color Management API

## Decision: .NET 9.0 ASP.NET Core Web API
**Rationale**: 
- Latest LTS version with performance improvements and native AOT support
- Excellent built-in OpenAPI/Swagger integration via Swashbuckle
- Mature ecosystem for web APIs with comprehensive testing frameworks
- Strong performance characteristics for sub-200ms response requirements
- Cross-platform deployment flexibility

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Node.js with Express**: Rejected due to less robust type safety and testing ecosystem
- **Python with FastAPI**: Rejected due to potentially slower response times for performance requirements
- **Go with Gin**: Rejected due to less comprehensive OpenAPI tooling integration

## Decision: In-Memory Storage with ConcurrentDictionary
**Rationale**:
- Requirement explicitly states "data is stored in memory"
- ConcurrentDictionary provides thread-safe operations without explicit locking
- Eliminates database setup complexity and latency for MVP
- Perfect for demonstration and testing purposes
- Can be easily abstracted behind repository pattern for future database migration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Dictionary with manual locking**: Rejected due to complexity and potential deadlock risks
- **Immutable collections**: Rejected due to performance overhead for write operations
- **MemoryCache**: Rejected as it's designed for caching, not primary storage

## Decision: xUnit Testing Framework
**Rationale**:
- De facto standard for .NET testing with excellent async support
- Excellent integration with Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing for API testing
- Built-in parallel test execution for faster test runs
- Strong assertion library and mocking support via Moq
- Comprehensive code coverage tooling integration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **NUnit**: Rejected due to less idiomatic integration with ASP.NET Core
- **MSTest**: Rejected due to fewer community extensions and less flexible fixture management

## Decision: OpenAPI/Swagger Specification
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for REST API documentation and contract definition
- Built-in Swagger UI provides interactive documentation requirement
- Enables contract-first development and testing
- Automatic client code generation capabilities
- Excellent tooling support for validation and testing

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Custom documentation**: Rejected due to manual maintenance overhead
- **GraphQL**: Rejected as requirements specify REST endpoints
- **Postman collections**: Rejected due to lack of contract validation capabilities

## Decision: Repository Pattern for Storage Abstraction
**Rationale**:
- Enables easy migration from in-memory to persistent storage later
- Improves testability by allowing mock repositories
- Separates business logic from storage implementation details
- Follows SOLID principles and dependency inversion
- Constitutional requirement for maintainable, testable code

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Direct controller-to-storage access**: Rejected due to tight coupling and poor testability
- **Service layer only**: Rejected due to mixing storage concerns with business logic

## Decision: Conflict Handling for SetColor
**Rationale**: 
Since the specification had [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior when color ID already exists], research into REST API best practices suggests:
- **PUT semantics**: Update/replace if exists, create if not exists (idempotent)
- This aligns with RESTful design principles
- Provides predictable behavior for API consumers
- Supports both creation and update scenarios with single endpoint

**Implementation**: SetColor will use PUT semantics - create if new, update if exists.

## Performance Considerations
**Response Time Target**: <200ms (95th percentile)
- In-memory operations: <1ms typical access time
- JSON serialization overhead: ~5-10ms for typical color objects
- HTTP overhead: ~10-20ms on local network
- Ample headroom for 200ms target even under load

**Concurrency Strategy**:
- ConcurrentDictionary for thread-safe reads/writes
- No explicit locking required for simple CRUD operations
- Stateless controller design for horizontal scaling
- Connection pooling handled by ASP.NET Core runtime

## Monitoring and Observability Strategy
**Logging**: 
- ASP.NET Core built-in ILogger with structured logging
- Request/response correlation IDs for tracing
- Performance metrics for all endpoint operations

**Health Checks**:
- Basic health endpoint for service availability
- Memory usage monitoring for in-memory storage
- Response time monitoring for performance requirements

**Error Handling**:
- Global exception handler for consistent error responses
- Validation error mapping to appropriate HTTP status codes
- Structured error responses with correlation IDs

## Security Considerations
**Input Validation**:
- Model validation attributes for color data
- Request size limits to prevent memory exhaustion
- Input sanitization for color names and values

**API Security**:
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration for browser-based access
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- No authentication required per spec (public API)

## Testing Strategy
**Contract Tests**:
- OpenAPI schema validation for all endpoints
- Request/response format verification
- HTTP status code validation

**Integration Tests**:
- Full HTTP request/response cycle testing
- Concurrent access testing for thread safety
- Performance testing for response time requirements
- Error scenario testing (invalid data, not found, etc.)

**Unit Tests**:
- Repository layer testing with various data scenarios
- Service layer business logic validation
- Controller action testing with mocked dependencies
- Edge case testing (empty collections, invalid IDs, etc.)
