# Feature Specification: API WebApp with Color Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-api-webapp-with`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The application is a API WebApp. Routes: GetAllColors, GetColor, GetRandomColor, SetColor. Include Swagger UI."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
API developers and consumers need a centralized color management service that provides access to a curated collection of colors. Users can retrieve all available colors, fetch specific colors, get random color suggestions, and manage the color collection through a well-documented API interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user needs to see all available colors, **When** they request the complete color list, **Then** they receive all colors with their identifiers and values
2. **Given** a user knows a specific color identifier, **When** they request that color, **Then** they receive the color details or an appropriate error if not found
3. **Given** a user wants color inspiration, **When** they request a random color, **Then** they receive a randomly selected color from the available collection
4. **Given** an administrator wants to add a new color, **When** they submit color information, **Then** the color is stored and becomes available through other endpoints
5. **Given** a developer wants to understand the API, **When** they access the documentation interface, **Then** they can explore all endpoints, see request/response examples, and test functionality

### Edge Cases
- What happens when requesting a color that doesn't exist?
- How does system handle invalid color data during creation?
- What occurs when the color collection is empty and random color is requested?
- How does the system respond to malformed requests?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an endpoint to retrieve all available colors in the collection
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide an endpoint to retrieve a specific color by its unique identifier
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide an endpoint to retrieve a randomly selected color from the available collection
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide an endpoint to add new colors to the collection
- **FR-005**: System MUST include interactive API documentation interface (Swagger UI) for all endpoints
- **FR-006**: System MUST return appropriate HTTP status codes for all operations (200 for success, 404 for not found, 400 for bad requests, etc.)
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate color data format and values before storage
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle requests for random colors when no colors exist in the collection
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide consistent response formats across all endpoints
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist color data between application restarts

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: API responses MUST return within 200ms for 95% of requests (per constitution performance standards)
- **NFR-002**: System MUST support concurrent requests from multiple clients
- **NFR-003**: API documentation MUST be accessible and navigable without external dependencies
- **NFR-004**: System MUST maintain 99.9% uptime during normal operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Color**: Represents a color entry with unique identifier, name, and color value (hex, RGB, or other standard format)
- **Color Collection**: The complete set of available colors managed by the system

## API Endpoint Specifications

### GetAllColors
- **Purpose**: Retrieve the complete collection of available colors
- **Success Response**: List of all color objects with their identifiers and values
- **Empty Collection**: Return empty array when no colors exist

### GetColor
- **Purpose**: Retrieve a specific color by its unique identifier
- **Input**: Color identifier parameter
- **Success Response**: Single color object with full details
- **Not Found**: Return appropriate error when color doesn't exist

### GetRandomColor
- **Purpose**: Provide a randomly selected color from the available collection
- **Success Response**: Single randomly chosen color object
- **Empty Collection**: Return appropriate error when no colors are available

### SetColor
- **Purpose**: Add or update a color in the collection
- **Input**: Color data including identifier, name, and color value
- **Validation**: Ensure color data meets format requirements
- **Success Response**: Confirmation of color creation/update
- **Conflict Handling**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior when color ID already exists - update or error?]

### Documentation Interface
- **Purpose**: Provide interactive API documentation and testing capabilities
- **Access**: Web-based interface accessible via standard browser
- **Features**: Endpoint documentation, request/response examples, live testing functionality
