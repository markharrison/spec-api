# Spec-API Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST adhere to strict quality standards: Static analysis tools (linters, formatters) configured and enforced in CI/CD; Code review required for all changes with focus on readability, maintainability, and security; Documentation MUST be present for all public APIs, interfaces, and complex business logic; Technical debt MUST be tracked and addressed systematically with defined remediation timelines.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Implementation begins; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced; Minimum 90% code coverage required for all production code; Contract tests MUST exist for all external interfaces and API boundaries; Integration tests required for all inter-service communication and data flow.

### III. User Experience Consistency
Consistent user interfaces and interactions across all touchpoints: Design system with reusable components enforced; Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum) MUST be met; Error messages and user feedback follow standardized patterns; Performance expectations clearly defined and measured (loading times, response times); User flows tested and validated through usability testing.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Performance standards are non-negotiable: API response times MUST be under 200ms for 95th percentile; Frontend initial page load MUST be under 2 seconds; Database queries optimized with monitoring and alerting; Resource usage monitored with defined thresholds; Performance regression testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline; Scalability requirements documented and validated through load testing.

### V. Observability and Monitoring
Complete system visibility required: Structured logging with correlation IDs across all services; Metrics collection for business and technical KPIs; Distributed tracing for request flow analysis; Health checks and alerting for all critical services; Security monitoring and audit logging for compliance; Performance monitoring with automated alerting on threshold breaches.

## Performance Standards

System performance requirements with measurable thresholds: API endpoints MUST respond within 200ms (95th percentile); Database queries optimized for sub-50ms execution time; Frontend applications MUST achieve Lighthouse scores of 90+ for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices; Memory usage monitored with alerts at 80% capacity; CPU utilization maintained below 70% under normal load; Network latency minimized through CDN and caching strategies.

## Development Workflow

Quality gates and review processes: All code changes require peer review with checklist verification; Automated testing pipeline MUST pass before merge; Security scanning integrated into CI/CD with zero critical vulnerabilities allowed; Performance impact assessment for significant changes; Documentation updates required for all feature additions; Deployment approval process with staged rollouts and rollback capability.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Amendments require: Documentation of rationale and impact assessment; Approval from project maintainers; Migration plan for existing code when applicable; All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles; Complexity and technical debt MUST be justified with clear remediation plans; Refer to project-specific guidance documents for implementation details and tooling requirements.
